# Driving with the Bluetooth Controller

See [MBot_Mega_Drive1](MBot_Mega_Drive1/README.md) for details on:
- Bluetooth controller ports, code, and examples
- Port assignments and code examples for:
    - Line follow sensors
    - Collision sensors
    - Motor and wheel movement
    - Using the LEDs

The mBlock examples are good if you're using Blocks, but if you want to use Arduino C++, it's tough to find resources on all of this.  See this readme for all of the details:
